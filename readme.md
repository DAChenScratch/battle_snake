# Battlesnake by bugabinga

A hand-rolled [Battlesnake]-AI-Server written for the JVM.

Some _arbitrary constraints_ have been placed on this project in order to explore the JDK.

- no external dependencies (besides a JDK)
- no build system
- use the module path
- write unit tests and integration tests
- write documentation
- ignore Java conventions
